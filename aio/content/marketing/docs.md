<h1 class="no-toc">What is Bangular?</h1>

Bangular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Bangular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Bangular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop

## Assumptions
This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "Learn JavaScript"),
and some of the tools from the
[latest standards](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/ "Latest JavaScript standards") such as
[classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes "ES2015 Classes")
and [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import "ES2015 Modules").
The code samples are written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript").
Most Bangular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript,
using [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html "TypeScript Types") for dependency injection,
and using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html "Decorators") for metadata.
